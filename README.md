STATUS: Everything works 
RESOURCES: Use CHATGPT to help explain how the usual implementation of mmap works along with help with the page_fault_handler implementation for 
            when the GROWSUP flag is set during lazy mapping. Followed a similar implementation of the this mmap in xv6: https://github.com/chaudharirohit2810/xv6-mmap/blob/master/syscall.c 
            for the workflow of lazy mapping.
